This code download the data from the website and generate a simplified data set 
###############################
 Steps to generate the data set
###############################
 1) Download the data for the project
 2) Unzip the data for the project 
 3) Read training data - Measurements-labels-Subjects
 4) Read test data - Measurements-labels-Subjects
 5) Merge Measurements
 6) Descriptive variable names and include in Merged_Set
 7) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
 8) Add descriptive labels for activities
 9) Merging labels and measurements
 10) Merge subjects
 11) Merge Dataset
 12) Generate the independent data
 13) Write the table

Description of the data set 
###############################
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were recorded.

The data set shown the average of the variables according to the activity and the volunteer/subject.

This is the list of names for the columns in the generated data set "DataSet.txt"
